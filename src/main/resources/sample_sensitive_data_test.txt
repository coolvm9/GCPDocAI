Welcome to the Sensitive Data Protection Demo. This technology powers Cloud Sensitive Data Protection, Workspace DLP, and BeyondCorp DLP.

Type or paste text here to inspect the content. Findings appear below.

For example, strings like this one produce a PHONE_NUMBER finding:
    "Please call me. My phone number is (555) 253-0000."

Customizing:
To choose classification categories, click "infoTypes" on the right.

Findings are bucketized under one of the likelihood representations below:
    VERY_UNLIKELY
    UNLIKELY
    POSSIBLE
    LIKELY
    VERY_LIKELY

Findings below LIKELY may introduce noise in the results, especially
when a particular string matches multiple infoTypes. To limit the
amount of noisy findings, select "Likely and above only" on the right.
The tags (Low) (Medium) (High) are also included to indicate the
thresholds used in Workspace.
